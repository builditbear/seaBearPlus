- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon, AKA Build-It Bear! 
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Web Development, writing small and portable utilities for 
commonly performed functions, Mobile Development for Android and iOS, and Video Game Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java programming, Data Structures and Algorithm, clean coding skills, and web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on virtually any open source project as a means to learn from my more experienced peers 
and become accustomed to coding on a team. I'm a bit shy about my code in particular, but I have excellent interpersonal skills 
coupled with an upbeat and patient attitude. I'm an exceptional team player at my current job, but I have never worked on a 
*software engineering* team specifically.
